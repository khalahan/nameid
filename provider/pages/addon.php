<h1>NameID Easy Login</h1>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><b>NameID</b> and in particular the
add-on are still in an early, experimental phase.  So please be warned,
although everything seemed to work fine in our tests.</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">This add-on is still under development, and
some ideas for improvements have not yet been implemented&mdash;please
excuse a lot of rough edges.  Nevertheless, if you have any ideas, comments
or suggestions, please <a href="?view=contact">contact me</a>!</div>

<p>Since the steps required for a fully manual sign-in are quite complicated
and troublesome, you can <b>automate them</b> by using the
<b>NameID add-on</b> for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>
browsers.  Try it out:</p>

<div class="offset1"><a class="btn btn-success"
      href="NameIdLogin-0.1.1a.xpi">NameID Easy Login<br />
<small>Version 0.1.1a</small></a></div>

<p class="padTop">When the add-on is installed, you have to make sure that the
<a href="https://dot-bit.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=998"><b>Namecoin-Qt</b></a>
daemon is running, and check the connection settings in the add-on's
preferences dialog.  Those must match your <code>namecoin.conf</code>
file.  When everything is set up, the add-on will allow you to automate
the signing procedure whenever it recognizes a login form for <b>NameID</b>.
It may ask for your Namecoin wallet passphrase in case you have an encrypted
and locked wallet, but appart from that, you only ever have to enter
the identity you want to use and submit.</p>
