<h1>FAQs</h1>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">What is Namecoin?</p>
  <p><a href="https://dot-bit.org/">Namecoin</a> is a peer-to-peer, completely
decentralised system based on <a href="https://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>
technology that allows everyone to register <i>names</i>.  After you own
a name, no-one can take it from you without your consent, and you can associate
data with it that everyone can be sure originated from you but which can neither
be forged nor censored by unauthorised attackers.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">How do Namecoin identities work?</p>
  <p>In the Namecoin system, there are multiple possible uses for names:  The
most common today is for
<a href="https://dot-bit.org/Namespace:Domain_names"><b>domain names</b></a>
(these are names with the <code>d/</code> prefix), but another possible
use-case is that of
<a href="https://dot-bit.org/Namespace:Identity"><b>identities</b></a>:
Those are names of the form <code>id/your-nick</code>, and they are
particularly interesting because you can, for instance, store your public keys
for <a href="http://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a>, your
<a href="https://bitmessage.org/">Bitmessage address</a> or other things
in their value field, so that you only need to tell someone your
(easily remembered) identity nick, and they can later access your keys
to send you encrypted messages and can be assured that the keys are indeed
yours.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">What is OpenID?</p>
  <p><a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a> is an open internet standard
that specifies a protocol for some webserver (your <i>identity provider</i>)
to authenticate you to another site (the <i>consumer</i>).  This is meant
as a solution to the problem of an ever-increasing amount of usernames and
passwords someone has to remember on the internet for accounts at a multitude
of sites.  With OpenID, you only ever need one account at some
trusted identity provider, and can then use it to sign into (or create
accounts at) millions of other OpenID-enabled &quot;consumer&quot; sites.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">So, how do Namecoin and OpenID relate?</p>
  <p><b>NameID</b> brings both concepts together:  It is an identity provider,
but you don't (and can't) have to create an account or even
remember a password.  Instead, you need a Namecoin identity (that is,
at the very least some <code>id/</code> name which you own, no matter
what values you have stored with it).  The password is replaced by
a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital
signature</a></b> with the private key associated to your name.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">Is it safe?</p>
  <p>With the digital signature
it is possible to prove to <b>NameID</b> that you are really the
owner of the identity you claim, without revealing any compromising data.
Even if <b>NameID</b> was malicious or the site cracked, you only ever run
the risk of an attacker signing into other OpenID sites with your
identity until you revoke it.  No-one is ever able to steal
the Namecoin identity
from you as long as your computer and Namecoin wallet are
safe.  Furthermore, at <b>NameID</b>
there is no list of passwords or account details that can ever be stolen.
All that is needed for us to identify you is the Namecoin blockchain, so
there's no need to keep any sensitive information around.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">How do I sign into an OpenID-enabled site?</p>
  <p>Simply enter <code>https://nameid.org/</code> into the
login-box.  You will be redirected to <b>NameID</b> where you can log in
with your name, and if that is successful, you will be returned to the
OpenID consumer site, where you are then authenticated with your identity.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">What do I need in order to use NameID?</p>
  <p>First of all, you need a 
<a href="https://dot-bit.org/Namespace:Identity"><b>Namecoin identity</b></a>,
and need the wallet that owns it on your local system.  Second, you need
<a href="https://dot-bit.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=998"><b>Namecoin-Qt</b></a>
installed and running, and need to be able to perform
<code>signmessage</code> commands with it.  Don't worry though, you can
install the <a href="?view=addon"><b>NameID Easy Login</b></a> add-on for
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> browsers, which takes
care of the signing for you.  And finally, you need some OpenID-enabled
sites you want to sign into.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">Where do I get a Namecoin identity from?</p>
  <p>Please consult the <a href="https://dot-bit.org/">Namecoin website</a>
for more details, or take a look at the
<a href="https://dot-bit.org/forum/">Namecoin forum</a> for help.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">Do you store any data about me?</p>
  <p>No!  But I'm glad you asked and care about protecting your data,
which is a good thing.  All data <b>NameID</b> needs to authenticate you
is already available via the Namecoin blockchain (and it is up to
you what data you want to share there with the public), so we don't have
to store anything.  It is true that <b>NameID</b> gets to know all OpenID
sites you sign into, but that is inevitable by the design of OpenID.  We
don't however store any of that data except standard server log files, which
are also discarded regularly (about every month).</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">Can I trust you?  Is it free?</p>
  <p>The answer to the second question is: <b>Yes, absolutely!</b>
The service provided is free as in free beer, I run <b>NameID</b>
as a service to the Namecoin community and to help it grow.  I don't
want to earn any money from it.  Furthermore, <b>NameID</b> is also
<b>free as in freedom</b> with the
<a href="https://gitorious.org/nameid/">source code</a>
available to anyone who wants to check it out or even reuse it for
own projects under the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"><b>GPL v3</b></a>.</p>
  <p>For the first question, you have to decide on your own whether or
not you trust me based on the information on this page.  In any case you can
also just
<a href="https://gitorious.org/nameid/">grab the source</a> and
set up <b>your own server</b> if you like the idea!</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">How can I use NameID in my own project?</p>
  <p>As mentioned in multiple other answers on this page, <b>NameID</b> is
free software and the code can be obtained from
<a href="https://gitorious.org/nameid/">Gitorious</a>.  You can use this
code more or less directly to set up a &quot;clone&quot; of <b>NameID</b>
on <b>your own server</b>.  Alternatively, you can even use the
<b>authentication code</b> to implement Namecoin login
<b>directly into your webservice</b> without the need to go through
<b>NameID</b> or any other third-party!  See <code>README.libauth</code>
in the sources for a how-to on this.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">Is the code signed?</p>
  <p>The source code in the
<a href="https://gitorious.org/nameid/">Git repository</a> has tags
signed by my key.  You can find the key fingerprint
on the <a href="?view=contact">contact page</a> or look it even
up in the blockchain for my own identity <code>id/daniel</code>.  If you
want to be sure to have the correct code, please check it out there and
verify the tags against my key.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">Does NameID have a .bit domain?</p>
  <p>In theory yes, I registered both
<a href="http://nameid.bit/">nameid.bit</a> and
<a href="http://myid.bit/">myid.bit</a> for it.  So far I haven't yet
configured them, though, but this will come in the future.  Note however that
you have to use <code>https://nameid.<b>org</b>/</code> for signing into
OpenID sites anyway, because otherwise it will most probably fail when the
consumer site tries to connect to <b>NameID</b> on its own in order to
verify your request.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">Can I help?</p>
  <p>Yes, definitely!  Every help is welcome&mdash;<a href="?view=contact">let
me know</a> if you have any ideas, comments or suggestions, and if you are
graphically skilled, <b>NameID</b> needs a cool logo.  If you are a coder,
you can surely also find some tasks to help out, and if you have some spare
coins, you can donate them to the addresses shown at the bottom of the page.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
  <p class="faq">I have more questions...</p>
  <p>Just <a href="?view=contact">contact me</a> and let me know how
I can help you.</p>
